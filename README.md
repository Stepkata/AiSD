# Basic sorting algorthms made for algorithms and data structures classes
---
This is a repository of sorting algorithms made for Algorithms and Data Structures classes.
This is an old code, made with the purpose of learning specific versions of the sorts and 
practising polymorphism. This is in no way the most optimal solution, but it might be educational.

Sorts include:
* heap sort
* insert sort
* merge sort
* merge sort (iterative)
* quick sort
* simplified bucket sort
* bucket sort

Sorts that use tables inherit after base class TableBasedSort
